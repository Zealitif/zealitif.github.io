  <h1>Cat Care Basics</h1>

  <p>
    Caring for a cat takes a lot of work, but with our tips and tricks, we can help lay down the essentials on what a cat needs to be happy and healthy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cats are lovable creatures; when given the basic care they need, they can flourish and easily become your best buddy. Often, they get a bad reputation through word of mouth. However, behavioral issues like biting and scratching aren’t common when a cat is taken care of using the tips Whisker Wisdom can provide.
  </p>

  <h2>The Environment</h2>
  <p>
    Cats often enjoy relaxing and calm environments. If there's any chance that they can sneak a calming nap in, they will take it. Even if you have a busy household, make sure that there’s one calm corner of your house—be it a whole bedroom they can hide away in or even a windowsill they can cozy up on. Making sure they have their own <i>“safe space”</i> is a great way to help them relax in your home, which is also theirs! A cat should feel like they're a part of the family, and they can treat you like family too.
  </p>

  <h2>Food</h2>
  <p>
    Remember that cats have a varying diet and shouldn’t be restricted to just one type of food. Be on the lookout for these varieties, such as canned (also called “wet”) food, kibble (also called “dry food”), and cat treats. While it’s best to avoid feeding cats human food, there are some exceptions, such as:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Unseasoned chicken, beef, or fish</li>
    <li>Cooked eggs</li>
    <li>Tuna</li>
    <li>Watermelon</li>
    <li>Pumpkin</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These can be fed to the cat in small portions—avoid overfeeding—and do not use seasonings or oil when preparing them. It is also advised <b>NOT</b> to feed a cat dairy. While media portrayals often show cats enjoying milk, the reality is that they are prone to getting sick from dairy. So, avoid letting your cat consume cow’s milk.
  </p>

  <h2>Grooming</h2>
  <p>
    A cat isn’t too high-maintenance when it comes to grooming; they don’t require frequent baths—only occasionally when there’s visible dirt or grease buildup. Most of the time, cats bathe themselves with their tongues. However, cats do need to be brushed and combed with appropriate tools depending on their coat length. Long-haired cats need grooming more often than short-haired ones. Nail care is also important: clipping or filing their nails is recommended. If the caretaker is unable to do this, a visit to a pet salon or veterinarian’s office is a good alternative.
