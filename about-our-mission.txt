<h1>About Out Mission/h1>

<p>Our goal is to provide a better community and life style to felines. Mother cats can have up to five litters of kittens a year! This can range from one to a dozen kittens per litter! Thats a lot of kitties. We want to give them a better chance at life and reduce the risk of them becoming strays or stuck in a shelter.</p>
